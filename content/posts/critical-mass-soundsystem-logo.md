I didn't expect this, so it came as a shock when a good friend of mine
[Dave Stewart](http://davestewart.co.uk/) decided to create a logo for
me. Here it is:

He kindly created an animated version as well, imagine the sound waves
acting as a graphic equalizer!

I don't have the time to work on this, but would love to see it. I wont
be at all mad if someone beats me to the line.
